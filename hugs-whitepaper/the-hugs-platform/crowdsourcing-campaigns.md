# üåê Crowdsourcing campaigns

On the Hugs Platform, **anyone can start a crowdsourcing campaign**. Contributing and starting campaigns is omni-directional on the Hugs Platform.

**In the traditional business world, a campaign is usually top-down** (initiated by a business or a product or process owner). These types of campaigns will typically focus on a specific issue and a small group of (expensive) experts will be hired to find those issues. Often a supplier is used to hire the experts. This group of experts aren't necessarily users of the Client's products.

Hugs, however, lets everyone - Clients (business / process / product owners), dApp builders, Contributors (users), Reviewers (quality control), and Affiliates (sales) - start a campaign. When running a campaign, **the campaign owner can ask the crowd to help** and focus on a specific issue for a specific time period.

Clients can take it one step further when starting and running a campaign. They can offer additional rewards for performing certain tasks. **The Client will have direct access to the crowd, without any intermediaries (suppliers).** Thanks to on-chain reputational data linked to each individual Contributor, the Client will be able to select actual users of his product offering and determine what the level of expertise and the reputation of that user should be.
