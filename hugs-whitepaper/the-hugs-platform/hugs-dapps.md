# ðŸ›  Hugs dApps

A Hugs dApp is a decentralised crowdsourcing application running on top of the Hugs platform. Anyone can create one by using our easy-to-use developer tools. This allows dApp builders to focus on the core functionalities of their application whilst Hugs takes care of the crowdsourcing aspect. The Hugs Platform itself mainly exists of programs (smart contracts) running on the Solana blockchain, making your dApps autonomous Web 3.0 applications.

### Why build a Hugs dApp?

Building a dApp on the Hugs platform has a lot of advantages both from a technical point of view and from a marketing and strategic one. The most important advantages are listed below:

* **Reduced development cost and fast time to market** - The Hugs platform offers a wide range of crowdsourcing functionalities. These features are ready-to-use and can drastically reduce development cost and time to market.
* **Open Source -** The Hugs platform is an open source platform, allowing any dApp builder to join the Hugs ecosystem.
* **Access to the Hugs community -** You are not the only one building on the Hugs Platform. Connect to other dApp builders and immediately reach the Hugs community to gain visibility for your project
* **A ready-to-use Web 3.0 layer -** Whilst Web 3.0 is exciting and has a lot of benefits, building on top of it requires experience and know-how. By building on the Hugs platform you can enjoy the benefits while we take care of the blockchain development.
* **Hugs Developer Tools -** An API and SDK helps you to use the Hugs Platform inside your dApp. If you prefer a less technical interface, low-code developer tools with limited functionalities are on our roadmap as well.
