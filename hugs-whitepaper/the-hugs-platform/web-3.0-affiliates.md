# ðŸ“ˆ Web 3.0 Affiliates

The Hugs Platform is a crowdsourced ecosystem with two groups of users on each end of the spectrum: Contributors and Clients. The platform works with both direct and indirect sales methods to connect these stakeholders with each other:

* Some Clients will find their way to the dApps built on top of the Hugs Platform and sign up for their service, resulting in a direct sale
* Our scalability, however, will come from the power of the indirect channel, where Affiliates introduce potential Clients to the Hugs Platform

To reach as many business owners as possible we will build a network of Hugs ambassadors, called Affiliates. On their dashboard, Affiliates receive a selection of user-initiated contributions for (potential) Clients.

#### Referral code

When the Client uses an Affiliate's referral code, the Affiliate receives a commission on the HUGS the Client generates.
