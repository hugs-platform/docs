# The HUGS Token

## Token specifics

### Token supply

The initial HUGS token supply is fixed at 100,000,000 (one hundred million) tokens. Each HUGS token can be divided into smaller units. HUGS is a Solana SPL token with 18 decimals. The smallest unit is therefore 0.000000000000000001 HUGS.&#x20;

### Token functionality

It is the mission of Hugs to build crowdsourcing solutions, solving various trust problems internet users are confronted with. The HUGS token is the utility token that will be used in crowdsourcing software solutions built on top of the Hugs Platform.

### Token sale phases

The current, first round of our early investor HUGS token sale is divided in two rounds:

1. Private Token Sale
2. Public Token Sale

A total of 25,000,000 (twenty-five million) HUGS tokens will be sold during the initial token sale.

### Token allocation

Twenty-five percent of the total supply of HUGS tokens will be sold during the token sale, and twenty percent of the total supply is reserved for the Hugs team.

Fifty-five percent of the HUGS token supply will be reserved for the development of the Hugs ecosystem. The goal is to provide funding for community initiatives focussing on crowdsourcing solutions willing to connect with the Hugs solutions and to provide liquidity for the HUGS token when it gets listed on an exchange.&#x20;

#### Token allocation explained

**Token sale**: the initial number of tokens sold to early investors. The proceeds of this token sale will be used by the Hugs team to cover design, market research, R\&D of its Apps, team growth, and operational costs.

**Development**: these tokens are reserved to cover the cost of development for our Platform and our proof of concepts, such as our Website Error Reporting POC, and our Smart Cities POC (both currently in design).

**Partnership incentives**: various partnerships will be established. Some partnerships require an investment in time and material. A number of tokens have been reserved to cover this.

**Marketing**: as is common practice in crypto and blockchain projects, Hugs will build a community of supporters. This includes affiliates, contributors, testers, etc. Valuable contributions can be rewarded with tokens.

**Hugs Reserve Pool**: a small number of tokens reserved to cover unexpected costs, such as unforeseen legal costs for example.

**Team and Advisors**: preceding the launch of the HUGS token, a number of enthusiasts and advisors have voluntarily contributed to the project. They will be rewarded with tokens for their time, expertise, and effort.

**Project Incentives**: these tokens are intended for incentivising early adopters of the Hugs ecosystem. Project Incentives tokens can also be used to provide liquidity on exchanges listing the HUGS token.

### Token Distribution

All tokens distributed as Partnership Incentives, Team, and Advisor incentives are vested until three months after the Token Sale is completed and will be released according to a nine-month token drip scheme with weekly token releases.

Vested tokens acquired during the private sale will be released according to a three-month token drip scheme with daily token releases.

HUGS tokens bought by public sale investors will be available shortly after the token sale is completed.

## Token functionalities

### In-app payments

The HUGS token was created as a utility token to let the Hugs clients pay for the use of software solutions offered by Hugs. It is our hope that businesses who start to use our Apps on a regular basis will eventually gain an interest in the advantages of using crypto to pay for in-app services.

## Token availability

### Initial Token sale

The initial token sale is scheduled for H1 2022. Both phases of this token sale are part of our early investor token sale, which is divided in a private sale and public sale. There is no set end date for the token sale. The goal is to sell all tokens reserved for this early investor token sale. Hugs may, however, decide at its sole discretion to conclude the token sale before all reserved tokens were sold out.

#### Acquiring tokens

To buy tokens, investors will have to register on the HUGS token sale platform and go through the mandatory KYC and AML checks prior to buying tokens.
