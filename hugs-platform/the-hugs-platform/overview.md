# ðŸ“„ Overview

Hugs is a decentralised Web 3.0 crowdsourcing platform, enabling application builders to connect users with business and process owners who want to benefit from the wisdom of the crowd.

In contrast to traditional crowdsourcing, users can take the initiative by:

* Suggesting improvements;
* Reviewing others' proposals, and
* Onboarding new businesses (called "Clients")

Users are rewarded appropriately thanks to our unique reward system with some HUGS tokens.&#x20;

The quality of contributions on our platform is crucial for all stakeholders as it immediately affects the value they gain from crowdsourcing dApps. A combination of two solutions is introduced by Hugs to solve this problem:

* The Hugs reviewer consensus mechanism, and
* The Hugs on-chain reputation metrics

We believe this approach provides a better guarantee for improving the world around us and for providing business owners with a continuous value stream.

The Hugs ecosystem consists of the following stakeholders:

* **App Builders -** Developers and companies who use the Hugs Developer tools to build unique crowdsourcing dApps. They can benefit from the Hugs core functionalities and ecosystem to bootstrap their application.
* **Affiliates -**  Users who onboard new Clients in the Hugs ecosystem are rewarded for their efforts. These users act as a decentralised sales force and are called Affiliates.
* **Clients -** Organisations (businesses, process owners, governments, ...) using the Hugs crowdsourcing dApps.
* **Contributors -** Users who make contributions in one or more Hugs dApps and earn rewards and build up personal reputation in the process.
* **Reviewers -** Independent users who review and rate contributions to guarantee the quality of the contributions.

There are a couple of unique value propositions that make the Hugs platform a unique and innovative approach for crowdsourcing:

* ****[**Hugs dApps**](hugs-dapps.md) **-** Developer tools allow developers and companies to use the Hugs functionalities in their (crowdsourcing) dApps.
  * **Low code developer tools** allow for a fast time to market and a low barrier to entry.
  * **APIs and SDKs** are also available for more advanced functionalities and control.
* ****[**Crowdsourcing Campaigns**](crowdsourcing-campaigns.md) **-** Crowdsourcing Campaigns can be created to attract more Contributors by issuing higher rewards.
* ****[**Reviewer Consensus**](reviewer-consensus.md) **-** Reviewer Consensus adds an extra layer of control to Contributions by selecting Reviewers to rate Contributions.
* ****[**User Rewards**](user-rewards.md) **-** Receive User Rewards by being actively involved on the Hugs platform as a Contributor, Reviewer or Affiliate.
* ****[**Reputation**](reputation-building.md) **-** Good behaviour is incentivised by our on-chain reputation metrics where users can build their Reputation Score and gain rewards in the process.
* ****[**Affiliates**](web-3.0-affiliates.md) **-** On-board new Clients on the Hugs platform, build Reputation and receive Rewards.
