# üí∞ User rewards

The Hugs Platform rewards every user making a valuable contribution with some HUGS tokens. Two different types of rewards will exist in the Hugs ecosystem.

### Primary Rewards - The Reward Pool

The Reward Pool is a unique smart contract, created by the Hugs team. The smart contract manages a pool of tokens and distributes a fixed percentage of these tokens amongst the Hugs users as a reward for their contributions to the Hugs ecosystem. A part of the fees paid by Clients will be poured back into the Reward Pool. Thanks to this circular token movement, the Reward Pool never runs dry as long as the Hugs Platform is used.

Contributors and Reviewers will always be rewarded with HUGS tokens from this Reward Pool for qualitative contributions that were accepted by the network of Reviewers (regardless of whether the Client accepts the issue or not).

Reviewers will also always receive a reward upon reaching consensus and under the prerequisite that their vote is part of the majority vote. Both types of confirmations, acceptance and rejection, will be rewarded.&#x20;

Because the Reviewers don't know each other (thanks to the randomly assigned issues) and because the outcome (Acceptance or Rejection) is unknown, there will be no incentive for a Reviewer to accept or reject issues without checking them. Not only would the Reviewer lose his Reward, but it would negatively impact his Reputation Score. This in turn would rapidly result in the Reviewer losing his status and thus in being ignored by the system.

For valuable contributions, rewards will automatically be allocated according to the following formula:

$$
ùëÖ=Œ± ùëÉùëü
$$

Where:

ùëÖ = the reward in HUGS given to the contributor

ùëÉùëü = the amount of HUGS in the Reward Pool

Œ± = a fixed percentage

By applying this formula, the number of HUGS tokens will gradually decrease month over month. This is inversely proportional to the growing number of users on the network. Without any new tokens being added to the Reward Pool, the platform would eventually run out of HUGS to distribute to Contributors and Reviewers as their Primary Reward.

For every paying transaction though (every time a Client accepts a contribution or starts a campaign), Hugs will reserve a part of its own received fee to pour it back into the Reward Pool. The result is an infinite supply of tokens available in the Reward Pool.

### Secondary Rewards - Client Fees

On top of the rewards distributed by the Reward Pool; Contributors, Reviewers, and Affiliates can receive a larger Secondary Reward. The Secondary Reward can be earned once a Client pays for the services on the Hugs Platform (usually via third-party dApps). These rewards will be higher than the Reward Pool tokens distributed after the Reviewers‚Äô acceptance of a contribution.

Clients can start Crowdsourcing Campaigns to attract seasoned Contributors. Crowdsourcing Campaigns are the equivalent of a typical crowdsourced bug bounty campaign. Part of the proceeds of such campaign will be distributed as Secondary Rewards amongst the Contributors and Reviewers who participated in such campaign.

Secondary rewards will be distributed as demonstrated in the following diagram:
