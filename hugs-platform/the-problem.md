# The Problem

**Traditional crowdsourcing** campaigns are typically introduced by a company trying to solve a certain problem by leveraging on the knowledge of a larger group of experts outside their own organisation. In IT, crowdsourcing is often used for quality control such as bug hunting.

The issue with this approach is that **the "crowd" is limited to a small group of experts** who focus on a specific task or problem. Old-school campaigns are expensive, often limited in time, and go hand in hand with **tunnel vision** because of the aforementioned limitations.

The real crowd - the users of a platform, product, or service - are often overlooked and their feedback not taken serious enough. In most cases client input tools are missing, and if there is a feedback mechanism, **tips and reported issues are seldom dealt** with and users never hear back from the company they contacted. Getting rewarded for their (often) valuable input is rare.

At HUGS we believe a user should be able to report any issue or tip a company about potential improvements at any time, even if the company does not have a feedback mechanism. Feedback should be logged in an immutable way, have a reward mechanism, let users build up a reputation, and score companies, projects, products, etc. based on their client-centricity.
