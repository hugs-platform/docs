# The objective

### Data quality

The objective of the Hugs Reviewer Network is to increase the quality of off-chain data by introducing an on-chain Reviewer Network.

To accomplish this, it uses a decentralised review process where $HUGS tokens and reputation are used as collateral, incentivising the Reviewer to execute a valuable Review.&#x20;

Reviews are typically manual interactions verifying the correctness of the data. Consumers  benefit from high quality Reviewed Data and reward Contributors and Reviewers for their efforts.
