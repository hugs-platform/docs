# The Problem

Micro-tasking, collaborative working, community projects, work from anywhere ... are all examples of how the world has changed in recent years. Contributors to a project aren't necessarily nine to five employees anymore. People contribute to various projects, often anonymously, which creates various levels of data quality.

Businesses, organisations, and communities using that input from the crowd therefor face unprecedented challenges. The quality and integrity of human-to-ecosystem contributions often cannot be checked by an automated algorithm or oracle.

The lack of quality control mechanisms and the ability to check a contributor's skills and expertise in a decentralised environment prevented this new way of collaborating from taking the next leap.

The Hugs Protocol tackles this by registering, reviewing, and rewarding contributions in the blockchain.
