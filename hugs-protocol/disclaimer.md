Legal Considerations&#x20;

Whilst we have approached the $HUGS Token Sale in a responsible manner, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and the use of distributed ledger technologies for the storage or transfer of value hold uncertain status in various jurisdictions. We have taken efforts to consider the legal status of the $HUGS Token and later Hugs Protocol model in the jurisdictions where we plan to operate.&#x20;

$HUGS Tokens are functional utility tokens designed for the Hugs Protocol. $HUGS Tokens are not securities. Once you purchase $HUGS Tokens, they cannot be refunded. We do not recommend that $HUGS Tokens be purchased for speculative investment purposes. You should buy $HUGS Tokens to participate in the Hugs Protocol. $HUGS Tokens have no voting rights, equity, or any other rights in Hugs Ltd. $HUGS Tokens are sold as digital assets. We do not recommend purchasing $HUGS Tokens unless you have prior experience with cryptocurrencies or digital asset tokens.&#x20;

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THERE ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PURCHASING, OWNING, AND USING THE $HUGS TOKENS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO BEING SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE VOLATILITY IN VALUE, UNANTICIPATED RISKS, SECURITY RISKS, UNINSURED RISKS, GOVERNANCE RISKS AND OTHER RISKS WHERE THE VALUE OF THE $HUGS TOKENS MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF THE VALUE OF YOUR ORIGINAL INVESTMENT. BEFORE PURCHASING $HUGS TOKENS YOU ARE REQUIRED TO READ THE TOKEN SALE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND THE RISKS SET OUT THEREIN AT APPENDIX 3 â€“ WWW.HUGSPLATFORM.COM
