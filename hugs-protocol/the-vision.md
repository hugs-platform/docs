# The Vision

The Hugs Protocol is a decentralised oracle, enabling quality assurance for on-chain data by using a distributed review network.

It allows for apps, platforms, organisations, and users to use a single underlying protocol to register and review user-generated data.

Expert reviewers check and validate data, safeguarding the quality of the contributions. At the same time contributors and reviewers build up an immutable blockchain-powered reputation in various areas of expertise.

The engine of the Hugs Protocol, enabling such qualitative distributed data gathering, is called the Hugs Reviewer Network (HRN). Fuel for the HRN is the protocol's native token $HUGS, which is used to pay for network fees and to pay out rewards to users. The token can also be used for reputational staking.
