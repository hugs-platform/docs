# Collateralized Reviews

### Hugs Token Usage

The Hugs Reviewer Network uses $HUGS tokens for a wide range of utilities each contributing to a unique mechanism.

#### $HUGS for curators

Curators choosing to stake tokens signal to the network that the corresponding Review Opportunity or Consumer has a great potential of generating rewards in the future. This way they act as prospecting agents giving valuable info to the rest of the network. The curator receives a share for his staked tokens which will generate rewards every time it is involved in a successful review. To maximise its yield, curators are incentivised to do research and stake tokens on promising and high-quality Review Opportunities and Consumers. Curators signalling rather unknown leads (with a lower curator stake), will provide the curator with a higher share of the reviewer rewards, leading to a competition of finding the new kid on the block with the highest potential.

#### $HUGS for delegators

By default, a Reviewer is only allowed to review a low number of contributions to prevent low-quality participants to have a high impact on the network. This is where delegation comes into play.

Anyone can delegate $HUGS tokens to their preferred reviewer, allowing them to process a higher volume of reviews. Delegators are rewarded with a percentage of the reviewer rewards, which gives them the incentive to choose reliable and successful reviewers.

The Hugs delegation mechanism gives tremendous insight in the expertise and trustworthiness of a reviewer and can be a determining factor, next to reputation, when choosing to interact with.

#### $HUGS as review collateral

Every reviewer has to stake a number of $HUGS as review collateral. When the a review is successfully disputed by a consumer, a part of this collateral will be slashed and used as rewards for the dispute committee.

This mechanism gives a direct economic incentive for a reviewer to provide high-quality reviews. Additionally, there is also an indirect incentive as slashing also has a negative impact on delegators.&#x20;
