# Collateralised Review Process

### Collateralized Review Process

The Hugs Reviewer Network (HRN) uses a collateralized review process to incentivize honest and trustworthy reviews. After a Reviewer receives a request on his Review Proposal he will be able to start the process by staking the amount of $HUGS tokens as indicated in the proposal. These tokens will be locked until the consumer accepts the review or a timeout occurs. (Tokens can also be unlocked after a consumer unsuccessfully asks for a refund. More on this later.) Next, consumers have the option to access the Review by locking the same number of tokens in an escrow account, which gives them access to the content. When the consumer confirms the Review has been executed correctly, the escrow account is used as payment for the Reviewer and the Contributor.

But what happens if the review did not happen as it should have happened and the Consumer wants to dispute the Review, hoping he can retrieve the amount locked in the escrow account?

In this case, the review will go to a dispute committee, existing of a set of reviewers with a high reputation. The dispute committee will execute the same collateralised review process and the majority consensus determines the outcome of the dispute. If the consumer wins the dispute, his escrow account is released and the reviewer collateral is divided among the committee. Alternatively, if the consumer loses the dispute, the escrow account is used instead to reward the committee.
