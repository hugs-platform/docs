# Introduction

The Hugs ecosystem consists of three main elements:

* The Hugs Protocol
* The Hugs Platform
* The Hugs Marketplace

This GitBook overview contains the two separate whitepapers, for both the Hugs Protocol and Hugs Platform.

### The Hugs Protocol

The Hugs Protocol is a decentralised oracle, enabling quality assurance for on-chain data by using a distributed review network. The Hugs Protocol is created and maintained by Hugs Limited, based in Gibraltar.

### The Hugs Platform

The Hugs Platform is a cloud-based, low-code solution, enabling developers to quickly create crowdsourcing dApps. Although being a SaaS solution, the Platform uses the Hugs Protocol in the back for quality assurance, by leveraging the review capabilities of the Hugs Protocol. The Hugs Platform is created and maintained by Hugs Labs BV, based in Belgium.

### The Hugs Marketplace

The Hugs Marketplace completes the Hugs ecosystem. Various apps and other tools can be built on the Hugs Protocol. The Hugs Marketplace aims to bring users and (d)App builders together. A separate whitepaper for the Hugs Marketplace is currently in the making.
